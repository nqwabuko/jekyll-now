My somewhat verbose blog entry on moving from MacOS to Fedora 26 with the Gnome Desktop Environment. Touching on things that mattered to me but are small and what could be described as niggles. 

### Intro

So this is something I been wanting to write for so long and have never had the time or the proper know-how. I am getting closer to that now and I want to start. This will be piece meal in the beginning as I try get myself writing everyday. 

Moving from Mac to Linux as a whole has been something I have been yearning to do for ages, I think the first time I played with a Linux distro was back when I heard about Virtualbox in 2011. Up until then I had used Windows through school etc and it killed me. I always knew that computers could offer more but I am not clever enough to pursue too much all at once. Anyway, I got to university and had bought a Mac (Macbook Pro 7.1 mid 2010 - because details are nice) because I heard they are reliable and let's be honest right now, they are beautiful. Anyway, I will write some more on the whole hardware thing. So I realised after some time that Mac runs off a UNIX core and I didn't really know what that means (I still don't really). I knew that it meant that the core was somewhat similar to Linux and I felt better about my move. I figured that the closer I got to Linux and Open Source the better I'd feel. I love the Open Source concept and sharing. I think it completely progressive and that the world is sutpid to think we will make any real developments if we sit our own caves and make people pay to come in. I also believe that anyone should be able to use any piece of tech or knowledge or whatever in the world because possession is an illusion. However, we live in a world that doesn't listen to that motto so we as *open* peeps have to be careful and choose our friends wisely #jobsvsgates. To cut this shorter (@warning I am prone to excessive verbage - I expect comments to idicate that haha), I am now here, running my same Mac and I have taken the plunge into Linux completely. I realised in the middle of it several things which I will write more about, but two main ones: if you have your files like music and pictures, the OS doesn't actually matter; do not underestimate the CLI in Linux, it has got power daymn! 

Just to give my post a general end goal, I want to show how nice the Fedora distro is running Gnome desktop environment and how you will really enjoy it if you are a user like me, coming from a Mac. I will explain more on what kind of user I am but in a nutshell, I use a computer for very general things like admin, browsing, office stuff, bit of image editing and publishing kind of stuff, through to a bit of hobbytronics and all in all I use it to get stuff done. I don't game and I don't do a lot of heavy graphics stuff either. I feel a computer should work nicely for you (this is both hardware and software of course) and that looking at it should be pleasant. Finally I want to address this thing of Open Source and how it eats me up inside when I am not using something that is free for everyone. I want to comment on how using great hardware coupled with great software leads to an end user experience that epitomises the modern interface between a human and a machine.

To end off this intro I basically want to say that I hope you enjoy reading my musings on this change in my lifestyle, because I think a computer is part of your life. We communicate through them, we view information through them, and for many we rely on them. 

### Fedora as an OS with Gnome

I should clarify that I mean __Fedora 26 workstation__ with Gnome Version **3.24.2**. I want to address what I consider an OS. Sure everyone, well not all but most, know that an OS is the operating system of the machine. I just want to indicate that when you commit to an OS, you commit to a whole bunch of things. Now for developers and the like they will laugh at me for trying to define all this but I also want to reach people who are not overly tech savvy and want to read about tech in a way that it is nice to read. To do that, sorry tech guys, I have to write in a 'friendlier' way. When you choose an OS you choose a lot of stuff that is under the hood, you choose a lot of things like the policies that govern the developers and the background of the company or individuals that run and maintain that OS. You choose a lot of obvious things like how it looks, how it runs on your machine and as is becoming the hinge point for many between OSes, what software you can use. If you bear with me I will break down these things a little so you can see where I am coming from and perhaps this will help you to either agree with me or rather show your distaste in my opinion. 

So the list:
1. Under the hood of the GUI
2. Policies
3. Looks
4. How it runs on your machine
5. What software you can use

##### 1. Under the hood of the GUI

Before we go ahead here, please know I am no super power when it comes to knowledge of display servers (the nuts and bolts of the graphic user interface (GUI)). I only know some basics and that a display is like a program in itself and that lots of OSes use different 'programs' to show you the GUI. Like if you think back to MSDOS, you know the old fashioned computers that only had a cursor and a black screen. They were OSes that didn't have a display program and so no GUI. Everyone today who isn't totally tech savvy likes to see what a computer is doing, they don't always like the command line interface (CLI), the thing with the cursor and the blackness. When you dive into an OS like Windows you use the **windows** GUI manager. That is actually the namesake of Microsoft Windows, the display server, the program that runs the GUI. It is called windows because you work with 'windows', the squares and rectangles that surround a program you open. Like Outlook has its own box or window and you can click on things inside it and the computer knows you want to talk to Outlook and not to your desktop where some people keep folders and shortcuts. So now with Microsoft (MS) Windows you're using ``windows`` and that takes care of how you do things like resizing a program window to take up the whole screen or minimise it to the bar at the bottom. So to zoom out now, we have the display server or the program that runs the GUI, we have to try stick with display server to practise the correct lingo. MS Windows has ``windows`` and Mac has this program called **Quartz**, which is the low-level graphics layer, and the **WindowServer** process manages windows on top of it. Both are Apple proprietary software. I must offer thanks to [Daniel Beck](https://superuser.com/users/22317/daniel-beck) who answered this type of question on StackExchange. Now we get to Linux and there are a lot and I do not aim to go through them and how they work, but in general you have **X** as the display server and then you have your desktop environment that does its thing, here we have Gnome or Unity (the one Ubuntu uses, albeit not for long). Now in Fedroa 26, we have the new display server called **Wayland** and I am not totally savvy on it yet. The point here is that these display servers all have their own quirks and possibilities and of course issues. We take it for granted that in MS Windows the close button is usually a red cross in top right hand corner and on Mac you have the three coloured dots on the top left. In Linux this can be totally customised and in my Fedora Gnome set up I have only the cross on the top right. These buttons do something for you with that window you are in, now this is simple and obvious, i.e. the cross closes the window. But what happens under the hood is where I am heading. In MS Windows you press the close button and if that was the only window of that program open, you close and end the program, well you hope at least, thanks to MS Windows being dodgy and all closed source and stuff, but anyway. In Mac when you hit the red button (there is a cross as well) you close that window but you don't end the program. So for some this is easy to understand but for some who perhaps grew up on MS Windows, this doesn't make sense. So, you see my point, every interaction you have with the GUI has a certain background, or under the hood, operation. Now given that I am aiming at moving from Mac to Fedora, I am aiming to highlight this simple fact, pressing the cross on the top right (Fedora) closes the program like in MS Windows. Simple. 

I don't want to go into more, but I hope this example shows you what happens when you change OS and how that filters down to changing your display server and how that changes how you interact with your programs and their windows.

#### 2. Policies

This will be short because I don't really know anything about this but I do know what implcations come out of policies and how they impact the choice you make with which OS you use. The simple contrast comes here, Linux vs. MS and Mac. Linux is free, editable (i.e. it can be yours and the people who made it don't mind, in fact they think it's cool). MS and Mac are proprietary, they collect information about you and of course the bottom line is that if you want to obtain them legally, you have to pay. Sure MacOS is free to download but you either have to build a specific computer with the right hardware combination called a Hackintosh or buy a Mac (the physical computer) and they are very pricey in general. So If you are a pure business person and like making money out of people by making them pay for what you have done and so on, then sure keep using MS and Mac. It isn't of course easy to just change becasue it might not be you who is in charge of the machine you use, I have to use MS Windows at work, but on my own machine at home I can choose. This is where it matters, at least for the beginning. If you can conquer yourself, which took me some time, you can board the Open Source train and maybe one day open your own office where all the machines run Linux! 

#### 3. Looks

This bit I am not sure how to proceed because there is a lot to say but at the same time there is so much customisation,it is impossible to talk about everything. Before we get going, we need to take note of a few tricks that make the Mac always 'appear' beautiful. A Mac machine will always have a great screen. Colours will be lovely and rich and the graphics card will be powerful, in general at least. So, it is not fair to compare this to a Linux machine that has a rubbish screen with a cheap graphics card. I am talking about the looks of the OS. How our cross to close a window might look and the task bar at the top or bottom and so on. Imagine a beautiful screen because that's ideal and if you are moving like I did from Mac to Linux, the screen will be great. When you look at a desktop you as a person will like certain things. Coming from Mac you will know the task bar at the top and the dock at the bottom. You will know of mission control and the dashboard and the whole swipe between full screen apps etc. All these little things make up a total _look_. This is what I am talking about. On a Mac this has all been thought out really well and refined to the max, but can you get in there and play? The short answer is not very easily and in general _no_. Now, when you leave a Mac and open a desktop like Ubuntu with Unity you might think this is similar but I don't like the colours. You might open Cinnamon from the Mint community and think that it is just like MS Windows and you thought you were moving forward. Now, on Fedora with Gnome, just the default installation, a lot of the aesthetic is actually really good. Straight off there is no dock, so you might not like that. However, one press of the 'super' key,which if you haven't configured things yet, is the ``cmd`` key to the left of the space bar, will bring up all your open windows and a dock on the left with your favourite apps. On this dock you can click the square matrix of dots and get a mission-control-like list of your apps. To me this is great. I used have my dock on auto hide so that I could use all of the screen's real estate. This isn't the case for all, but once you start writing a lot or really get stuck into a program to get something done, the dock is in the way and taking up space. So while I was writing my thesis for my masters, I used to put the dock away and I got used to it being out the way. So when I started playing Fedora before I moved, I like the fact that there was no dock and that you could get one by ramming your mouse into the top left corner or hitting the ``cmd`` key. I also used to use the Mac shortcut of ``cmd``+``space`` to bring up Spotlight and I would launch apps from there because scrolling through lists, albeit beautiful and like an app drawer on a phone, it is a waste of time and you can easily lose a minute or more because you are tired and you can't spot the app you are after, this is assuming you don't keep it in the dock. So, the 'mission control' Fedora or rather Gnome style was actually perfect for me. You just ram the mouse in the corner and start typing your desired application and you're away. 

Now onto another little thing that I used to love about Mac and was worried I would not get on Linux without some huge effort on the CLI and tweaking and so on. I wanted a picture to be quickly previewed with the space bar while in the file manager. If you have the standard Fedora with Gnome install going, you will have a little app called **sushi** installed and that gives you the same behaviour. The app is actually based on the Mac concept. When I figured this out, I was so glad and it again re-affirmed I was moving in the right direction.
